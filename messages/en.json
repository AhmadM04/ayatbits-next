    "q1": "What is AyatBits?",
    "a1": "AyatBits is an interactive Quran learning app that uses word puzzles to help you memorize and understand the Quran. By arranging words in the correct order, you actively engage with each ayah, making memorization more effective and enjoyable.",
    "q2": "How does the puzzle system work?",
    "a2": "Each puzzle presents you with the words of an ayah in a shuffled order. Your task is to drag or tap the words to arrange them in the correct sequence. This active engagement helps reinforce your memory of the verse structure and word order.",
    "q3": "What happens if I make mistakes?",
    "a3": "You have 3 attempts per puzzle. If you exceed the mistake limit, you'll be prompted to review the ayah before trying again. This ensures you understand the verse before moving on.",
    "q4": "How do streaks work?",
    "a4": "Your streak increases by 1 for each consecutive day you complete at least one puzzle. If you miss a day, your streak resets to zero. Streaks help motivate consistent daily practice.",

    "a5": "We offer 18+ translations including English (Sahih International, Pickthall, Yusuf Ali), Arabic Tafsir, French, German, Spanish, Turkish, Urdu, Indonesian, Malay, Bengali, Hindi, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Dutch.",
    "q6": "Can I use AyatBits offline?",

    "q7": "How is my progress saved?",
    "a7": "Your progress is automatically saved to your account. Every puzzle you complete, ayah you like, and streak you build is stored securely. You can access your progress from any device by signing in.",
    "q8": "What is the 7-day free trial?",
